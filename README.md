# **Project Documentation: AiCloset App**

## **1. Clean Code Principles**

## **Recognizing Bad Code**
- Issues identified: **opacity, rigidity, inseparability, and fragility** due to unclear naming, hardcoded values, and implicit dependencies.
- Refactoring steps:
  - Improved function names.
  - Removed hardcoded values.
  - Modularized dependencies.
  - Implemented effective logging.

## **Key Takeaways from Clean Code Videos**
- **Readability & Clarity**: Write expressive code that communicates intent without excessive comments.
- **Refactoring Techniques**:
  - "Extract Till You Drop"
  - **Feature Envy**
  - Modularization for focused functions.
- **Polymorphism & Encapsulation**: Adhere to OOP principles.
- **Commenting Best Practices**:
  - Avoid unnecessary comments.
  - Remove outdated comments.
  - Rely on self-explanatory code.
- **Code Formatting & File Management**: Keep files concise, structured, and maintainable.

## **Application of Learnings**
- Optimized code for readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

## **4. Key Architectural Decisions & Insights**

## **API Authentication & Security**
- AiCloset API requires user authentication.

### **Theme Mode Considerations**
- Supporting themes early is a good practice.
- Initially implementing Light theme only.

## **Color Storage Best Practices**
- Storing colors in a centralized Kotlin file.

### **Database Schema Planning**
- Structured Room DB design focusing on products, closet items, and user preferences.

## **Local Image Storage Strategy**
- **Hybrid Approach**:
  - Store low-res copies & metadata in DB.
  - Store high-res images in file storage.

## **Image Storage Visibility**
- Images will be private and synced with the server.
- No retention post-app uninstallation.

## **Image Background Handling**
- Check if AiCloset API provides background-free images.
- Explore background removal techniques if not provided.

## **Next Steps**
- Design a scalable local database schema.
- Implement efficient image storage.
- Confirm API image format and plan background removal.
